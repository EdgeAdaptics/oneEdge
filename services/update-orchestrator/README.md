# Update Orchestrator (Stub)

Placeholder for the OTA pipeline orchestrator (TUF/Uptane/SUIT). Planned responsibilities:

- Manage firmware/model artifacts and metadata
- Coordinate phased rollouts across device cohorts
- Integrate with attestation results and console policy engine

The current PoC only provides the directory scaffold.
